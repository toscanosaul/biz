abstract = {In this paper, we present a new iterative method that combines the
simulated annealing method and the ranking and selection procedures
for solving discrete stochastic optimization problems. The number
of visit to every state by the proposed algorithm is used to estimate
the optimal solution. We show that the configuration that has been
visited most often in the first m iterations converges almost surely
to a globally optimum solution. We present empirical results that
illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

abstract = {We describe an adaptive dose escalation scheme for use in cancer phase
I clinical trials. The method is fully adaptive, makes use of all
the information available at the time of each dose assignment, and
directly addresses the ethical need to control the probability of
overdosing. It is designed to approach the maximum tolerated dose
as fast as possible subject to the constraint that the predicted
proportion of patients who receive an overdose does not exceed a
specified value. We conducted simulations to compare the proposed
method with four up-and-down designs, two stochastic approximation
methods, and with a variant of the continual reassessment method.
The results showed the proposed method effective as a means to control
the frequency of overdosing. Relative to the continual reassessment
method, our scheme overdosed a smaller proportion of patients, exhibited
fewer toxicities and estimated the maximum tolerated dose with comparable
accuracy. When compared to the non-parametric schemes, our method
treated fewer patients at either subtherapeutic or severely toxic
dose levels, treated more patients at optimal dose levels and estimated
the maximum tolerated dose with smaller average bias and mean squared
error. Hence, the proposed method is promising alternative to currently
used cancer phase I clinical trial designs.},

@article{Bardwell2011,
abstract = {Following on from the success of the previous crystal structure prediction blind tests (CSP1999, CSP2001, CSP2004 and CSP2007), a fifth such collaborative project (CSP2010) was organized at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. A range of methodologies was used by the participating groups in order to evaluate the ability of the current computational methods to predict the crystal structures of the six organic molecules chosen as targets for this blind test. The first four targets, two rigid molecules, one semi-flexible molecule and a 1:1 salt, matched the criteria for the targets from CSP2007, while the last two targets belonged to two new challenging categories - a larger, much more flexible molecule and a hydrate with more than one polymorph. Each group submitted three predictions for each target it attempted. There was at least one successful prediction for each target, and two groups were able to successfully predict the structure of the large flexible molecule as their first place submission. The results show that while not as many groups successfully predicted the structures of the three smallest molecules as in CSP2007, there is now evidence that methodologies such as dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) are able to reliably do so. The results also highlight the many challenges posed by more complex systems and show that there are still issues to be overcome.},

abstract = {We analyze relationships among local minima for the traveling salesman
and graph bisection problems under standard neighborhood structures.
Our work reveals surprising correlations that suggest a globally
convex, or �big valley� structure in these optimization cost surfaces.
In conjunction with combinatorial results that sharpen previous analyses,
our analysis directly motivates a new adaptive multi-start paradigm
for heuristic global optimization, wherein starting points for greedy
descent are adaptively derived from the best previously found local
minima. We test a simple instance of this method for the traveling
salesman problem and obtain very significant speedups over previous
multi-start implementations.

abstract = {The analysis of stochastic models is often greatly complicated if
there are censored observations of the random variables. This paper
characterizes families of distributions which help keep tractable
the analysis of such models. Our primary motivation is to provide
guidance to practitioners in the selection of distributions: If a
modeler feels that no member of the families we characterize is a
reasonable approximation, then he will almost surely encounter serious
analytic and computational problems if his data include censored
observations. We characterize a family of distributions for which
there exist fixed-dimensional sufficient statistics of purely censored
observations. We also characterize an important subset of this family,
appropriate for situations where data include both censored and exact
observations. We derive the corresponding predictive distributions
using arbitrary priors and present some general results relating
stochastic dominance among predictive distributions to the parameters
of the prior. We also analyze the cases of discrete and mixed random
variables.},

@article{Brennan2007,
abstract = {We describe a novel process for transforming the efficiency of partial expected value of sample information (EVSI) computation in decision models. Traditional EVSI computation begins with Monte Carlo sampling to produce new simulated data-sets with a specified sample size. Each data-set is synthesised with prior information to give posterior distributions for model parameters, either via analytic formulae or a further Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A further 'inner level' Monte Carlo sampling then quantifies the effect of the simulated data on the decision. This paper describes a novel form of Bayesian Laplace approximation, which can be replace both the Bayesian updating and the inner Monte Carlo sampling to compute the posterior expectation of a function. We compare the accuracy of EVSI estimates in two case study cost-effectiveness models using 1st and 2nd order versions of our approximation formula, the approximation of Tierney and Kadane, and traditional Monte Carlo. Computational efficiency gains depend on the complexity of the net benefit functions, the number of inner level Monte Carlo samples used, and the requirement or otherwise for MCMC methods to produce the posterior distributions. This methodology provides a new and valuable approach for EVSI computation in health economic decision models and potential wider benefits in many fields requiring Bayesian approximation.},

The goal is to minimize the number of tosses to identify a coin i* such that prob\{coin i* is most biased\} is at least 1-$\backslash$delta$\backslash$ for any given $\backslash$delta>0. Under a particular probabilistic model, we give an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that minimizes the expected number of tosses, to learn a most biased coin. The problem is equivalent to finding the best arm in the multi-armed bandit problem using adaptive strategies. Dar et al. (2002) and Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) show upper and lower bounds matching up to constant factors on the number of coin tosses for several underlying settings of the bias probabilities. For a class of such settings we bridge the constant factor gap by giving an optimal adaptive strategy -- a strategy that performs the best possible action under any given history of outcomes. For any given history, tossing the coin chosen by our strategy minimizes the expected number of tosses needed to learn a most biased coin. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that employs an optimal adaptive strategy under a Bayesian setting for this problem.},

by approximately evaluating a parallel set of designs, and reduces
the required simulation time dramatically for discrete-event simulation

that the selected designs contain at least one good design is crucial

abstract = {Ordinal Optimization has emerged as an efficient technique for simulation
and optimization. Exponential convergence rates can be achieved in
many cases. In this paper, we present a new approach that can further

enhance the efficiency of ordinal optimization. Our approach determines
a highly efficient number of simulation

replications or samples and significantly reduces the total simulation
cost. We also compare several different

allocation procedures, including a popular two-stage procedure in
simulation literature. Numerical testing shows

that our approach is much more efficient than all compared methods.
The results further indicate that our approach

can obtain a speedup factor of higher than 20 above and beyond the
speedup achieved by the use of ordinal

optimization for a 210-design example.

@article{ChIn01a,
abstract = {Standard "indifference-zone" procedures that allocate computer resources
to infer the best of a finite set of simulated systems are designed

with a statistically conservative, least favorable configuration assumption
consider the probability of correct selection (but not the opportunity

cost) and assume that the cost of simulating each system is the same.
Recent Bayesian work considers opportunity cost and shows

that an average case analysis may be less conservative but assumes
a known output variance, an assumption that typically is violated
in

simulation. This paper presents new two-stage and sequential selection
procedures that integrate attractive features of both lines of research.

They are derived assuming that the simulation output is normally distributed
with unknown mean and variance that may differ for each

system. We permit the reduction of either opportunity cost loss or
the probability of incorrect selection and allow for different replication

costs for each system. The generality of our formulation comes at
the expense of difficulty in obtaining exact closed-form solutions.

We therefore derive a bound for the expected loss associated potentially
incorrect selections, then asymptotically minimize that bound.

Theoretical and empirical results indicate that our approach compares
favorably with indifference-zone procedures.},

abstract = {Roitman and Shadlen [Roitman J. D., \& Shadlen M. N. (2002). Response of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area during a combined visual discrimination reaction time task. Journal of Neuroscience, 22, 9475-9489] have published a non-human primate study on visual decision making. They collected both behavioral and neurophysiological data and provided evidence that the data are qualitatively consistent with a mechanism based on accumulating sensory evidence up to a decision threshold. I have previously demonstrated that a time-variant diffusion model can account quite well quantitatively for both the behavioral and the neural data. In this manuscript I discuss how well the data constrains different components and parameters of the computational process. I also discuss the biological plausibility of the model parameters. I will demonstrate that a relatively large class of models, both with and without temporal integration and both stationary and time-variant could account for the behavioral data. Both the single cell recordings from the parietal cortex and previously published data from the extrastriate visual cortex provide additional constraints. Overall, the data favor a diffusion model with time-variant gain and leaky integrators. The integration time constant, however, turns out not to be well-constrained by the data.},

estimation using mixtures of Dirichlet processes. These models provide
natural settings for density estimation and are exemplified by special
cases where data are modeled as a sample from mixtures of normal
distributions. Efficient simulation methods are used to approximate
various prior, posterior, and predictive distributions. This allows
for direct inference on a variety of practical issues, including
problems of local versus global smoothing, uncertainty about density
estimates, assessment of modality, and the inference on the numbers
of components. Also, convergence results are established for a general
class of normal mixture models.},

abstract = {We review techniques for optimizing stochastic discrete-event systems
via simulation. We discuss both the discrete parameter case and the
continuous parameter case, but concentrate on the latter which has
dominated most of the recent research in the area. For the discrete
parameter case, we focus on the techniques for optimization from
a finite set: multiple-comparison procedures and ranking-and-selection
procedures. For the continuous parameter case, we focus on gradient-based
methods, including perturbation analysis, the likelihood ratio method,
and frequency domain experimentation. For illustrative purposes,
we compare and contrast the implementation of the techniques for
some simple discrete-event systems such as the (s, S) inventory system
and theGI/G/1 queue. Finally, we speculate on future directions for
the field, particularly in the context of the rapid advances being
made in parallel computing.},

abstract = {Diagnosis of a disease and its treatment are not separate, one-shot activities. Instead, they are very often dependent and interleaved over time. This is mostly due to uncertainty about the underlying disease, uncertainty associated with the response of a patient to the treatment and varying cost of different diagnostic (investigative) and treatment procedures. The framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) developed and used in the operations research, control theory and artificial intelligence communities is particularly suitable for modeling such a complex decision process. In this paper, we show how the POMDP framework can be used to model and solve the problem of the management of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), and demonstrate the modeling advantages of the framework over standard decision formalisms.},

abstract = {Traditionally a pursuit of large pharmaceutical companies, high-throughput screening assays are becoming increasingly common within academic and government laboratories. This shift has been instrumental in enabling projects that have not been commercially viable, such as chemical probe discovery and screening against high-risk targets. Once an assay has been prepared and validated, it must be fed with screening compounds. Crafting a successful collection of small molecules for screening poses a significant challenge. An optimized collection will minimize false positives while maximizing hit rates of compounds that are amenable to lead generation and optimization. Without due consideration of the relevant protein targets and the downstream screening assays, compound filtering and selection can fail to explore the great extent of chemical diversity and eschew valuable novelty. Herein, we discuss the different factors to be considered and methods that may be employed when assembling a structurally diverse compound collection for screening. Rational methods for selecting diverse chemical libraries are essential for their effective use in high-throughput screens.},

alternative systems.

There is therefore significant interest in procedures that efficiently
select the best system,

where best is defined by the maximum or minimum expected simulation
output. In this paper,

we examine both two-stage and sequential procedures that represent
three structurally

different modeling methodologies for allocating simulation replications
to identify the best

system, and we evaluate them empirically with respect to several measures
of effectiveness.

Empirical evidence suggests that sequential procedures perform better
than their two-stage

counterparts, including a heuristic sequential variation on Rinott�s
procedure. Further, there

appears to be significant benefit to using procedures based on a Bayesian,
average-case

analysis as opposed to the statistically-conservative indifference-zone
formulation.},

abstract = {A method is presented for extracting the configurational entropy of solute molecules from molecular dynamics simulations, in which the entropy is computed as an expansion of multidimensional mutual information terms, which account for correlated motions among the various internal degrees of freedom of the molecule. The mutual information expansion is demonstrated to be equivalent to estimating the full-dimensional configurational probability density function (PDF) using the generalized Kirkwood superposition approximation (GKSA). While the mutual information expansion is derived to the full dimensionality of the molecule, the current application uses a truncated form of the expansion in which all fourth- and higher-order mutual information terms are neglected. Truncation of the mutual information expansion at the nth order is shown to be equivalent to approximating the full-dimensional PDF using joint PDFs with dimensionality of n or smaller by successive application of the GKSA. The expansion method is used to compute the absolute (classical) configurational entropy in a basis of bond-angle-torsion internal coordinates for several small molecules as well as the change in entropy upon binding for a small host-guest system. Convergence properties of the computed entropy values as a function of simulation time are investigated and comparisons are made with entropy values from the second generation Mining Minima software. These comparisons demonstrate a deviation in -TS of no more than about 2 kcal/mol for all cases in which convergence has been obtained.},

abstract = {\{"\}...[can we] automate the scientific process is of both great theoretical
interest \& increasing practical importance because, in many scie.
areas, data are being generated much faster than they can be effectively
analysed. We describe a physically implemented robotic system that
applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles
of scientific exp'n. [It] automatically originates hypotheses to
explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses,
physically runs the experiments using a lab' robot, interprets the
results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, \& then
repeats the cycle. ...apply the system to the determination of gene
function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
\& auxotrophic growth experiments. We built \& tested a detailed
logical model (involving genes, proteins \& metabolites) of the aromatic
amino acid synthesis pathway. In biological experiments that automatically
reconstruct parts of this model, ... intelligent experiment selection
strategy is competitive with human performance \& significantly outperforms,
with a cost decrease of 3-fold \& 100-fold (respectively), both cheapest
\& random-experiment selection.\{"\} 15 Jan 2004: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature02236

@article{Lipkin2008,
abstract = {Increasingly, chemical libraries are being produced which are focused on a biological target or group of related targets, rather than simply being constructed in a combinatorial fashion. A screening collection compiled from such libraries will contain multiple analogues of a number of discrete series of compounds. The question arises as to how many analogues are necessary to represent each series in order to ensure that an active series will be identified. Based on a simple probabilistic argument and supported by in-house screening data, guidelines are given for the number of compounds necessary to achieve a "hit", or series of hits, at various levels of certainty. Obtaining more than one hit from the same series is useful since this gives early acquisition of SAR (structure-activity relationship) and confirms a hit is not a singleton. We show that screening collections composed of only small numbers of analogues of each series are sub-optimal for SAR acquisition. Based on these studies, we recommend a minimum series size of about 200 compounds. This gives a high probability of confirmatory SAR (i.e. at least two hits from the same series). More substantial early SAR (at least 5 hits from the same series) can be gained by using series of about 650 compounds each. With this level of information being generated, more accurate assessment of the likely success of the series in hit-to-lead and later stage development becomes possible.},

abstract = {The tumour microenvironment regulates tumour progression and the spread of cancer in the body. Targeting the stromal cells that surround cancer cells could, therefore, improve the effectiveness of existing cancer treatments. Here, we show that magnetic nanoparticle clusters encapsulated inside a liposome can, under the influence of an external magnet, target both the tumour and its microenvironment. We use the outstanding T2 contrast properties (r2=573-1,286 s(-1) mM(-1)) of these ferri-liposomes, which are ∼95 nm in diameter, to non-invasively monitor drug delivery in vivo. We also visualize the targeting of the tumour microenvironment by the drug-loaded ferri-liposomes and the uptake of a model probe by cells. Furthermore, we used the ferri-liposomes to deliver a cathepsin protease inhibitor to a mammary tumour and its microenvironment in a mouse, which substantially reduced the size of the tumour compared with systemic delivery of the same drug.},

abstract = {Acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterases (AcpH) are the only enzymes known to remove the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety from holo acyl carrier proteins (ACP), which are a large family of proteins essential for the biosynthesis of lipid and other cellular metabolites. Here we report that the AcpH (paAcpH) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble and stable protein after optimization of the expression and purification conditions. This marks an improvement from the aggregation-prone E. coli AcpH that could only be obtained by refolding the polypeptide obtained from the inclusion body. With the soluble recombinant protein, we found that PaAcpH exhibits preferred substrate specificity towards the ACPs from the fatty acid synthesis pathway among eight carrier proteins. We further showed that PaAcpH hydrolyzes and releases the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl group-linked products from a multidomain polyketide synthase, demonstrating that the enzyme is fully capable of hydrolyzing acylated ACP substrates.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of finding the simulated system with the best (maximum or minimum) expected performance when the number of alternatives is finite, but large enough that ranking-and-selection (R\&S) procedures may require too much computation to be practical. Our approach is to use the data provided by the first stage of sampling in an R\&S procedure to screen out alternatives that are not competitive, and thereby avoid the (typically much larger) second-stage sample for these systems. Our procedures represent a compromise between standard R\&S procedures-which are easy to implement, but can be computationally inefficient-and fully sequential procedures-which can be statistically efficient, but are more difficult to implement and depend on more restrictive assumptions. We present a general theory for constructing combined screening and indifference-zone selection procedures, several specific procedures and a portion of an extensive empirical evaluation.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of biomineralization and the realization of biology-inspired inorganic materials formation largely depends on our ability to manipulate peptide/solid interfacial interactions. Material interfaces and biointerfaces are critical sites for bioinorganic synthesis, surface diffusion, and molecular recognition. Recently adapted biocombinatorial techniques permit the isolation of peptides recognizing inorganic solids that are used as molecular building blocks, for example, as synthesizers, linkers, and assemblers. Despite their ubiquitous utility in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and medicine, the fundamental mechanisms of molecular recognition of engineered peptides binding to inorganic surfaces remain largely unknown. To explore propensity rules connecting sequence, structure, and function that play key roles in peptide/solid interactions, we combine two different approaches: a statistical analysis that searches for highly enriched motifs among de novo designed peptides, and, atomistic simulations of three experimentally validated peptides. The two strong and one weak quartz-binding peptides were chosen for the simulations at the quartz (100) surface under aqueous conditions. Solution-based peptide structures were analyzed by circular dichroism measurements. Small and hydrophobic residues, such as Pro, play a key role at the interface by making close contact with the solid and hindering formation of intrapeptide hydrogen bonds. The high binding affinity of a peptide may be driven by a combination of favorable enthalpic and entropic effects, that is, a strong binder may possess a large number of possible binding configurations, many of which having relatively high binding energies. The results signify the role of the local molecular environment among the critical residues that participate in solid binding. The work herein describes molecular conformations inherent in material-specific peptides and provides fundamental insight into the atomistic understanding of peptide/solid interfaces.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The discovery of solid-binding peptide sequences is accelerating along with their practical applications in biotechnology and materials sciences. A better understanding of the relationships between the peptide sequences and their binding affinities or specificities will enable further design of novel peptides with selected properties of interest both in engineering and medicine. RESULTS: A bioinformatics approach was developed to classify peptides selected by in vivo techniques according to their inorganic solid-binding properties. Our approach performs all-against-all comparisons of experimentally selected peptides with short amino acid sequences that were categorized for their binding affinity and scores the alignments using sequence similarity scoring matrices. We generated novel scoring matrices that optimize the similarities within the strong-binding peptide sequences and the differences between the strong- and weak-binding peptide sequences. Using the scoring matrices thus generated, a given peptide is classified based on the sequence similarity to a set of experimentally selected peptides. We demonstrate the new approach by classifying experimentally characterized quartz-binding peptides and computationally designing new sequences with specific affinities. Experimental verifications of binding of these computationally designed peptides confirm our predictions with high accuracy. We further show that our approach is a general one and can be used to design new sequences that bind to a given inorganic solid with predictable and enhanced affinity.},

Our experiments show that the pyrrole coring of the Trp and aromatic ring of Phe of these peptides are preferentially adsorbed on silver nanoparticles. However, the geometry of the rings and the strength of the interactions with this surface vary among peptides. Additionally, these peptides are weakly coordinated to the colloidal silver surface through the CO fragment of a peptide bond, between Gln/Leu/His and Trp residues, and CNC and SC fragments. Also, using the recently reported SERS spectra of these peptides immobilized onto an electrochemically roughened silver electrode surface, we demonstrate substrate-induced changes in the adsorption behavior of these peptides. Comparative analysis indicates that the interactions between peptides and the enhancing surfaces depend strongly on the geometry of the Trp, CONH, and SC fragments of these biomolecules etched on the surfaces.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates in the use of access log data as a source of information for identifying related scientific papers. This is done for arXiv.org, the authority for publication of e-prints in several fields of physics. Compared to citation information, access logs have the advantage of being immediately available, without manual or automatic extraction of the citation graph. Because of that, a main focus is on the question, how far user behavior can serve as a replacement for explicit meta-data, which potentially might be expensive or completely unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and citation-based measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a final result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search for them actively.},

While citation data is often used as an indicator of relatedness, in this paper we demonstrate that digital access records (e.g. http-server logs) can be used as indicators as well. In particular, we show that measures based on co-access provide better coverage than co-citation, that they are available much sooner, and that they are more accurate for recent papers.},

abstract = {How do we decide where to look next? During natural, active vision,
we move our eyes to gather task-relevant information from the visual
scene. Information theory provides an elegant framework for investigating
how visual stimulus information combines with prior knowledge and
task goals to plan an eye movement. We measured eye movements as
observers performed a shape-learning and -matching task, for which
the task-relevant information was tightly controlled. Using computational
models, we probe the underlying strategies used by observers when
planning their next eye movement. One strategy is to move the eyes
to locations that maximize the total information gained about the
shape, which is equivalent to reducing global uncertainty. Observers'
behavior may appear highly similar to this strategy, but a rigorous
analysis of sequential fixation placement reveals that observers
may instead be using a local rule: fixate only the most informative
locations, that is, reduce local uncertainty.},

abstract = {Phase I clinical trials are typically small, uncontrolled studies
designed to determine a maximum tolerated dose of a drug which will
be used in further testing. Two divergent schools have developed
in designing phase I clinical trials. The first defines the maximum
tolerated dose as a statistic computed from data, and hence it is
identified, rather than estimated. The second defines the maximum
tolerated dose as a parameter of a monotonic dose-response curve,
and hence is estimated. We review techniques from both philosophies.
The goal is to present these methods in a single package, to compare
them from philosophical and statistical grounds, to hopefully clear
up some common misconceptions, and to make a few recommendations.
This paper is not a review of simulation studies of these designs,
nor does it present any new simulations comparing these designs.},

@article{Schutte2004,
abstract = {Present day engineering optimization problems often impose large computational
demands, resulting in long solution times even on a modern high-end
processor. To obtain enhanced computational throughput and global
search capability, we detail the coarse-grained parallelization of
an increasingly popular global search method, the particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm. Parallel PSO performance was evaluated
using two categories of optimization problems possessing multiple
local minima�large-scale analytical test problems with computationally
cheap function evaluations and medium-scale biomechanical system
identification problems with computationally expensive function evaluations.
For load-balanced analytical test problems formulated using 128 design
variables, speedup was close to ideal and parallel efficiency above
95\% for up to 32 nodes on a Beowulf cluster. In contrast, for load-imbalanced
biomechanical system identification problems with 12 design variables,
speedup plateaued and parallel efficiency decreased almost linearly
with increasing number of nodes. The primary factor affecting parallel
performance was the synchronization requirement of the parallel algorithm,
which dictated that each iteration must wait for completion of the
slowest fitness evaluation. When the analytical problems were solved
using a fixed number of swarm iterations, a single population of
128 particles produced a better convergence rate than did multiple
independent runs performed using sub-populations (8 runs with 16
particles, 4 runs with 32 particles, or 2 runs with 64 particles).
These results suggest that (1) parallel PSO exhibits excellent parallel
performance under load-balanced conditions, (2) an asynchronous implementation
would be valuable for real-life problems subject to load imbalance,
and (3) larger population sizes should be considered when multiple
processors are available. Copyright � 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of partitioning a set of normal populations,
with respect to a control population, into two subsets according
to their unknown means, under the indifference zone formulation.
For this problem Tong (1969) constructed a two-stage and purely sequential
procedures and recently Datta and Mukhopadhyay (1998) have considered
various multistage methodologies emphasizing the second-order asymptotics.
However, all these methodologies adopt a vector-at-a-time sampling
approach and lack the desirable feature of eliminating treatments
from further sampling at an earlier stage. We propose an elimination
type sequential procedure using the Paulson's (1964) elimination
idea and design a sampling methodology which eliminates �superior�
and �inferior� treatments during the sampling, thereby reducing the
average sample size considerably. Theoretical results are obtained
to show that the proposed elimination-type procedure maintains the
probability of correct partition above a pre specified level. The
proposed procedure is studied and compared via the Monte Carlo simulation
studies with other competitive procedures known in the literature,
under both the LFC and a few non-LFC configurations. The elimination-type
procedure is found to be vastly more efficient than its competitors
in terms of average sample size.},

abstract = {We present an approximation to a molecule's N-dimensional conformational probability density function (pdf) in terms of marginal pdfs of highest order l, where l is much less than N. The approximation is constructed as a product of conditional pdfs derived by recursive application of the generalized Kirkwood superposition approximation. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented to sample conformations from the approximate full-dimensional pdf based upon all input marginal pdfs. The sampling algorithm is tested for three small molecule systems by using the algorithm to sample conformations at levels l=1, 2, or 3 and comparing the distributions of sampled conformations with those from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The distributions of conformations sampled at third (l=3) order resemble the MD distributions rather well and significantly better than those sampled at second (l=2) or first (l=1) order. In addition to highlighting the importance of correlations among internal degrees of freedom, these results suggest that low-order correlations suffice to describe most of the conformational fluctuations of molecules in a thermal environment.},

@article{Tan2010,
abstract = {Peptides are multifunctional reagents (reducing and capping agents) that can be used for the synthesis of biocompatible metal nanoparticles under relatively mild conditions. However, the progress in peptide synthesis of metal nanoparticles has been slow due to the lack of peptide design rules. It is difficult to establish sequence-reactivity relationships from peptides isolated from biological sources (e.g., biomineralizing organisms) or selected by combinatorial display libraries because of their widely varying compositions and structures. The abundance of random and inactive amino acid sequences in the peptides also increases the difficulty in knowledge extraction. In this study, a "bottom-up" approach was used to formulate a set of rudimentary rules for the size- and shape-controlled peptide synthesis of gold nanoparticles from the properties of the 20 natural alpha-amino acids for AuCl(4)(-) reduction and binding to Au(0). It was discovered that the reduction capability of a peptide depends on the presence of certain reducing amino acid residues, whose activity may be regulated by neighboring residues with different Au(0) binding strengths. Another finding is the effect of peptide net charge on the nucleation and growth of the Au nanoparticles. On the basis of these understandings, several multifunctional peptides were designed to synthesize gold nanoparticles in different morphologies (nanospheres and nanoplates) and with sizes tunable by the strategic placement of selected amino acid residues in the peptide sequence. The methodology presented here and the findings are useful for establishing the scientific basis for the rational design of peptides for the synthesis of metal nanostructures.},

abstract = {The whole-genome sequence assembly (WGSA) problem is among one of the most studied problems in computational biology. Despite the availability of a plethora of tools (i.e., assemblers), all claiming to have solved the WGSA problem, little has been done to systematically compare their accuracy and power. Traditional methods rely on standard metrics and read simulation: while on the one hand, metrics like N50 and number of contigs focus only on size without proportionately emphasizing the information about the correctness of the assembly, comparisons performed on simulated dataset, on the other hand, can be highly biased by the non-realistic assumptions in the underlying read generator. Recently the Feature Response Curve (FRC) method was proposed to assess the overall assembly quality and correctness: FRC transparently captures the trade-offs between contigs' quality against their sizes. Nevertheless, the relationship among the different features and their relative importance remains unknown. In particular, FRC cannot account for the correlation among the different features. We analyzed the correlation among different features in order to better describe their relationships and their importance in gauging assembly quality and correctness. In particular, using multivariate techniques like principal and independent component analysis we were able to estimate the "excess-dimensionality" of the feature space. Moreover, principal component analysis allowed us to show how poorly the acclaimed N50 metric describes the assembly quality. Applying independent component analysis we identified a subset of features that better describe the assemblers performances. We demonstrated that by focusing on a reduced set of highly informative features we can use the FRC curve to better describe and compare the performances of different assemblers. Moreover, as a by-product of our analysis, we discovered how often evaluation based on simulated data, obtained with state of the art simulators, lead to not-so-realistic results.},

It proposes a new procedure, called controlled sequential bifurcation (CSB) that is like SB, but has theoretical guarantees on performance.  In particular, it controls for Type I error and power.
        
The paper has a nice example problem that we could use.  Another nice example problem would be the case study done by the first-semester Cornell ORIE MEng students.  Either example is something that we could ask Rutna to implement.
        
I should read about group-screening.

"Mike is better to judge papers on this that you can look at, but I'm attaching the one that describes a related peptide to what we hope to find, that was found by phage display (a genetic combinatorial library approach that links peptide sequence to DNA-code, and can hence byisolated from low concentration hits via PCR amplification.)

        
Also, in an email from Nick Kosa on 4/3, "Additionally, the 2005 Walsh paper “Genetically encoded short peptide tag\ldots”I sent previously has a few peptides that work with Sfp and AcpS PPTases. I should have included those in the excel spreadsheet, in retrospect."  I replied on 4/3, "I'll make sure we get those additional peptides pulled out of the Walsh paper before we run our analysis."

        
In other words. It's an approach for searching huge amounts of sequence space in long sequencesand extracting hits."},
